Java Performance Management
---------------------------

## Java Memory Organization
- Simulate high memory Java Process
	- Configure Java Runtime parameters
- Java Process Memory
	- Visualize or Compute the Active Java process memory
		- Plot the usage in different types of memory blocks (Heap/YG/OG/Native/Metaspace etc.)
	- Tools and techniques
	- Memory Analysis
- Memory Optomization
	- Efficient Coding
	- Best pr
- GC Strategy & Optomization
	- Maximize multi-thread throughput

## Java Process - CPU
- Simulate CPU intensive Java Process
- CPU Efficient Code
- Parallel Execution (Threads & Native Process)
- Thread Synchronization

## Multi-JVM Process
 - Data sharing between multi-jvm
 - Native process synchronization

## Debuging Memory Leak
 - Approach & Identification
 - Tools to detect

## Performance Testing

## Memory requirement for containers

## Java 8 & above features
